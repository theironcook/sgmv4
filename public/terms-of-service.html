FEES; TAXES; PAYMENTS</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">5.1 </span><span class="c2">Fees</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;For subscription Clients, the fees and payment terms are set forth in the Order Form. &nbsp;For month-to-month Clients, the fees and payment terms are set forth on Pricing Document. SaaSGlue reserves the right to deny Client access to the System upon its failure to pay any amount due, which failure persists after the cure period set forth in Section 7.3, except where</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(i) there is a bona fide dispute over the amount due; and</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(ii) Client has paid all undisputed amounts in full, as due.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">5.2 </span><span class="c2">Taxes</span><span class="c4">. &nbsp;Fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including but not limited to value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any local, state, provincial, federal or foreign jurisdiction (collectively, “</span><span class="c3">Taxes</span><span class="c0">”). Client is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with the Services under this Agreement and all Order Forms or the Pricing Document (as applicable), excluding Taxes based solely on SaaSGlue’s net income. If SaaSGlue is deemed to have the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Client is responsible under this paragraph, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by Client, unless Client provides SaaSGlue with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">5.3 </span><span class="c2">Payments</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;Except as otherwise set forth in any Order Form or the Pricing Document, payments hereunder from Client to SaaSGlue shall be made without offset or deduction of any kind. For subscription Clients, payments shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account set forth in the Order Form attached hereto or such other account as SaaSGlue may designate from time to time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Amounts not received within thirty (30) days when due and not the subject of a bona fide good faith dispute shall be subject to a late charge of the larger of prime plus two (2) percent per month or two (2) percent per month of the delinquent amount, calculated from the due date until paid (“</span><span class="c3">Late Charges</span><span class="c0">”). &nbsp;SaaSGlue shall be entitled to recover from Client the costs and expenses incurred in connection with collecting Late Charges (including without limitation costs of investigation and reasonable attorneys’ fees). &nbsp;For the avoidance of doubt, any breach of this Paragraph 5 will constitute a material breach of this Agreement.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The following sections (1) through (6) apply only to month-to-month Clients:</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">(1) SaaSGlue uses a third-party payment processor to bill such Clients through a payment account linked to such Clients’ accounts. The processing of payments is subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policy of the payment processor, in addition to this Agreement. SaaSGlue is not responsible for any error by, or other acts or omissions of, payment processor. By choosing to be a month-to-month Client, Client agrees to pay SaaSGlue, through the payment processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use of the Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms, and Client authorizes SaaSGlue, through the payment processor, to charge Client’s chosen payment provider (the “</span><span class="c3">Payment Method</span><span class="c0">”). Client agrees to make payment using that selected Payment Method. SaaSGlue reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes that the payment processor makes even if it has already requested or received payment. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(2) The terms of Client’s payment will be based on Client’s Payment Method and may be determined by agreements between Client and the financial institution, credit card issuer or other provider of Client’s chosen Payment Method. If SaaSGlue, through the payment processor, does not receive payment from Client, Client agrees to pay all amounts due on for Client’s use of the Services upon demand. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(3) Client hereby acknowledges that the Services have a recurring payment feature, and Client accepts responsibility for all recurring charges prior to cancellation. SAASGLUE MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES (E.G., MONTHLY) WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM CLIENT, UNTIL CLIENT PROVIDES PRIOR NOTICE (RECEIPT OF WHICH IS CONFIRMED BY SAASGLUE) THAT CLIENT HAS TERMINATED THIS AUTHORIZATION OR WISHES TO CHANGE CLIENT’S PAYMENT METHOD. SUCH NOTICE WILL NOT AFFECT CHARGES SUBMITTED BEFORE SAASGLUE REASONABLY COULD ACT. TO TERMINATE CLIENT’S AUTHORIZATION OR CHANGE CLIENT’S PAYMENT METHOD, CLIENT MUST GO TO ITS ACCOUNT SETTINGS OR OTHERWISE NOTIFY SAASGLUE IN WRITING.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(4) CLIENT MUST PROVIDE CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE INFORMATION FOR CLIENT’S ACCOUNT. CLIENT MUST PROMPTLY UPDATE ALL INFORMATION TO KEEP CLIENT’S ACCOUNT CURRENT, COMPLETE AND ACCURATE (SUCH AS A CHANGE IN BILLING ADDRESS, CREDIT CARD NUMBER, OR CREDIT CARD EXPIRATION DATE), AND CLIENT MUST PROMPTLY NOTIFY SAASGLUE OR PAYMENT PROCESSOR IF CLIENT’S PAYMENT METHOD IS CANCELED (E.G., FOR LOSS OR THEFT) OR IF CLIENT BECOMES AWARE OF A POTENTIAL BREACH OF SECURITY, SUCH AS THE UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OR USE OF CLIENT’S PASSWORD. IF CLIENT FAILS TO PROVIDE ANY OF THE FOREGOING INFORMATION, CLIENT AGREES THAT SAASGLUE MAY CONTINUE CHARGING CLIENT FOR ANY USE OF SERVICES UNDER CLIENT’S ACCOUNT UNLESS CLIENT HAS TERMINATED THE SERVICES AS SET FORTH ABOVE.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(5) If the amount to be charged to Client’s account varies from the amount Client preauthorized (other than due to the imposition or change in the amount of state sales taxes), Client has the right to receive, and SaaSGlue shall provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled date of the transaction. Any agreement Client has with Client’s payment provider will govern Client’s use of Client’s Payment Method. Client agrees that SaaSGlue may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges, including during or at the end of each billing cycle. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">(6) Unless Client opts out of auto-renewal, which can be done through Client’s account settings, use of the Services will be automatically extended for successive renewal periods of one month. To change or resign the month-to-month Services at any time, go to account settings. &nbsp;If Client terminates the month-to-month Services, Client may use its task runs until the end of Client’s then-current term, and Client’s account will not be renewed after Client’s then-current term expires. However, Client will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of task runs purchased but not used for the then-current monthly period, and agrees to make all payments for task runs used at the end of the term. If Client does not want to continue to be charged on a recurring monthly basis, Client must cancel the Agreement through Client’s account settings or by contacting SaaSGlue in writing before the end of the recurring monthly term. Month-to-month accounts cannot be terminated before the end of the monthly period, and SaaSGlue will not refund any fees that Client has already paid. Client’s non-termination or continued use of the Services reaffirms that SaaSGlue is authorized to charge Client’s Payment Method for the Services. SaaSGlue may submit those charges for payment and Client will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive SaaSGlue’s right to seek payment directly from Client. Client’s charges shall be payable at the end of the month on a per task run usage basis.</span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c7">6.
